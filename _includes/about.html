  <h1>Our Mission</h1>
  <p>
  The BEAT Lab's mission is to develop multiscale computational and experimental tools to advance our knowledge of cardiovascular biomechanics and electrophysiology, employ our tools to improve cardiovascular health, and to train a new, diverse generation of biomedical engineers. We have a particular interest in growth and remodeling, and collaborate closely with clinicians to focus on research questions that are relevant to patient health and strive to integrate our models in the clinic to make a direct impact on healthcare.</p>

  <p>We will open our doors in the Spring of 2022 at UC Irvine, within the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Edwards Life Sciences Foundation Cardiovascular Innovation and Research Center.</p>

    <p>The onset and progression of cardiac disease as well as the outcome of clinical therapies is determined by a complicated interplay between (electro)physiology, mechanics, growth &amp remodeling, and neurohormonal signaling. We develop multiscale computational models to increase our understanding of the inner workings of the heart, test new hypotheses, design experiments, and to improve and design clinical therapies.</p>

    <h2>Experimental models</h2>
    <img src="{{ '/assets/cardiomyocytes.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="margin-top: 0.5em;width:300px;">
    <p>The extent of cardiomyocyte remodeling is related to changes in their mechanical and neurohormonal environment and often differs in different directions, a fact that is crucial for clinical prognosis and treatment. We are developing, aided by computational models, an experimental platform to unravel the mechanics of anisotropic cardiomyocyte remodeling.

    <h2>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy</h2>
    <img src="{{ '/assets/CRT.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width:300px;">
    <p>Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy has emerged as a potentially effective therapy to reverse heart failure. Interestingly, it can be personalized for each patient, yet there are far too many options for the clinicians to test during the implantation procedure. We are, in close collaboration with clinicians, developing a fast, patient-specific computer model to improve the success rate of CRT and treat heart failure in more patients.</p>
